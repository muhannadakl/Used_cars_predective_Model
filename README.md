# Used Car Price Analysis

## 🚗 Project Overview
[This data analytics project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a used car dataset to demystify the key factors that drive vehicle pricing. By moving beyond gut feelings and leveraging data, this analysis provides a transparent, quantitative framework for understanding what makes a used car valuable.]

## 📊 Business Problem
[The used car market is a minefield of uncertainty. Buyers struggle to answer "Is this a fair price?", while sellers ask "What should I list my car for?". Pricing often seems arbitrary, influenced by hidden factors and subjective opinions. This project tackles that opacity head-on by using data to answer a critical question:

"What features truly determine a used car's price, and by how much?"]
